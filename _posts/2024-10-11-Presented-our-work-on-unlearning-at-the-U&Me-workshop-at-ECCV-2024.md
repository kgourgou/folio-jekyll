I presented our work on unlearning at the [U&Me workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/u-and-me-workshop) at ECCV 2024. The workshop was a great opportunity to discuss the latest research on unlearning and to meet other researchers working on similar topics.

Frankly the highlight was the invited talks by David Bau and Rita Cucchiara. [They both shared their slides](https://sites.google.com/view/u-and-me-workshop/schedule), so there's no reason for me post pictures here.
