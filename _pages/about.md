Hello! üëã

I‚Äôm currently a research scientist / ML lead at [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence). I like to work in the intersection of language modelling and uncertainty quantification.

Before JPMorgan, I was a senior research scientist in the AI group of [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/), working on ML for automated health diagnostics.

And before that, I was a PhD student in Mathematics at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu), working on computational statistical physics and information theory. I was supervised by [Markos Katsoulakis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~markos/) and [Luc Rey-Bellet](https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/). My thesis was titled ‚ÄúInformation metrics for predictive modeling and machine learning‚Äù and can be found at [UMass Scholarworks](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/dissertations_2/1006/).
