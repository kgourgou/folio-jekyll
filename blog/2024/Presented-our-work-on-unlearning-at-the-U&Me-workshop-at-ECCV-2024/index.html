The workshop was a great opportunity to discuss the latest research on unlearning and to meet other researchers working on similar topics.</p> <p>Frankly the highlight was the invited talks by David Bau and Rita Cucchiara. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/u-and-me-workshop/schedule" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">They both shared their slides</a>, so there’s no reason for me post pictures here.</p> </body></html>
